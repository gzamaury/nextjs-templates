# This template ships an example Next.js app with Storybook + PrimeReact

This example shows a default set up of Storybook using [storybook-addon-next](https://github.com/RyanClementsHax/storybook-addon-next). Included in this example are stories that demonstrate the ability to use Next.js and PrimeReact features in Storybook.

### TypeScript

As of v6.0, Storybook has built-in TypeScript support, so no configuration is needed. If you want to customize the default configuration, refer to the [TypeScript docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/typescript).
